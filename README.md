# my project Raja Tech - Full-Stack Development Services
## my Website:
My [Website](https://github.com/Parre87/projekt1) purpose was to create a fictional consulting company that offers its own employees to companies looking for competent full-stack developers. The website contains three pages "Home", "About us" and "Reach us". The content of "Home" is to present information about the services that the company can offer. The services are based on what Code Institute offers in its Web Development program. The "About us" page contains information about the web developer students and "Reach me" page contains information on how to reach the company via a contact form.

The users targeted with this website are employers, recruiters and also the web-development community.

### Other tools used:
- The footer icons and were taken from **Iconfinder**, https://www.iconfinder.com/icons.

### Features left to implement:

The website and the fictitious company are in an early stage and what you see right now is just appearance. For example, the contact form does not work if you want to send a message, but the link to social media works.

## Testing:

- I've tested the website on Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge. I also used Chrome developer tools to check responsiveness.
- I have used a mobile and different devises to see how the website looks like on different screen sizes.
- I have clicked all the buttons and forms to see if it works.
- I confirmed that the Website and its functionnalities is working properly.
