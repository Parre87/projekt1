# my project Website hire fullstack developers
## my Website:
My [Portfolio Website](https://github.com/Parre87/projekt1) The purpose of the website was to create a fictional company that hires Fullstack students. The website contains three pages "Home", "About us" and "Reach us". The content of "Home" is to present information about the services that the company can offer. The services are based on what Code Institute offers in its Web Development program. The "About us" page contains information about which students can be hired and later on the "Reach me" page there is a contact form to fill out if you are interested with information about what needs to be included in the message.

The users targeted with this website are employers, recruiters and also the web-development community.
