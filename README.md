# my project Raja Tech - Full-Stack Development Services
## my Website:
My [Portfolio Website](https://github.com/Parre87/projekt1) The purpose of the website was to create a fictional company that hires Fullstack students. The website contains three pages "Home", "About us" and "Reach us". The content of "Home" is to present information about the services that the company can offer. The services are based on what Code Institute offers in its Web Development program. The "About us" page contains information about the web developer students and "Reach me" page contains information on how to reach the company via a contact form.

The users targeted with this website are employers, recruiters and also the web-development community.
